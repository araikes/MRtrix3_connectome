## Description

This BIDS App enables generation and subsequent group analysis of structural connectomes
generated from diffusion MRI data. The analysis pipeline relies primarily on the *MRtrix3*
software package, and includes a number of state-of-the-art methods for image processing,
tractography reconstruction, connectome generation and inter-subject connection density
normalisation.

**NOTE**: App is still under development; script is not guaranteed to be operational
for all use cases.

## Requirements

Due to use of the Anatomically-Constrained Tractography (ACT) framework, correction of
EPI susceptibility distortions is a prerequisite for this pipeline. Currently, this is
only possible within this pipeline through use of the FSL tool `topup`, which relies
on the presence of spin-echo EPI images with differences in phase encoding to estimate
the causative inhomogeneity field. In the absence of such data, this pipeline is not
currently applicable; though recommendations for alternative mechanisms for such
correction in the Issues page are welcome, and development of novel techniques for
performing this correction are additionally underway.

While many common DICOM conversion software are capable of providing data characterising
the phase and slice encoding performed in the acquisition protocol, which are subsequently
used by this pipeline to automate DWI data pre-processing, for some softwares and/or
some data (particularly those not acquired on a Siemens platform), such data may not be
present in the sidecar JSON files for files in the BIDS `dwi/` and `fmap/` directories.
In this circumstance, it will be necessary for users to manually enter the relevant
information into these files in order for this script to be capable of processing the
data. Every JSON file in these two directories should contain the BIDS fields
`PhaseEncodingDirection` and `TotalReadoutTime`. For DWI data, it is also preferable to
provide the `SliceEncodingDirection` and `SliceTiming` fields. More information on these
data can be found in the [BIDS documentation](http://bids.neuroimaging.io/).

## Instructions

The [bids/MRtrix3_connectome](https://hub.docker.com/r/bids/mrtrix3_connectome/) Docker
container enables users to generate structural connectomes from diffusion MRI data using
state-of-the-art techniques. The pipeline requires that data be organized in accordance
with the [BIDS specification](http://bids.neuroimaging.io).

In your terminal, type:
```{bash}
$ docker pull bids/mrtrix3_connectome
```

To query the help page of the tool:

```{bash}
$ docker run -i --rm bids/mrtrix3_connectome
```

To run the script in participant level mode (for processing one subject only), use e.g.:

```{bash}
$ docker run -i --rm \
      -v /Users/yourname/data:/bids_dataset \
      -v /Users/yourname/output:/output \
      bids/mrtrix3_connectome \
      /bids_dataset /output participant --participant_label 01 --parcellation desikan
```

Following processing of all participants, the script can be run in group analysis mode
using e.g.:

```{bash}
$ docker run -i --rm \
      -v /Users/yourname/data:/bids_dataset \
      -v /Users/yourname/output:/output \
      bids/mrtrix3_connectome \
      /bids_dataset /output group
```

If you wish to run this script on a computing cluster, we recommend the use of
[Singularity](http://singularity.lbl.gov/). Although built for Docker, this container
can be converted using the
[`docker2singularity` tool](https://github.com/singularityware/docker2singularity).

The script ``mrtrix3_connectome.py`` can additionally be used *outside* of this Docker
container, as a stand-alone Python script build against the *MRtrix3* Python libraries.
Using the script in this way requires setting the ``PYTHONPATH`` environment variable to
include the path to the *MRtrix3* ``lib/`` directory where it is installed on your local
system, as described [here](http://mrtrix.readthedocs.io/en/latest/troubleshooting/FAQ.html#making-use-of-python-scripts-library).
When used in this way, the command-line interface of the script will be more consistent
with the rest of *MRtrix3*. Note however that this script may make use of *MRtrix3*
features or bug fixes that have not yet been merged into the ``master`` branch; in this
case, it may be necessary to install the same version of *MRtrix3* as that installed
within "``Dockerfile``".

## Documentation

The help page of the tool itself can be generated by executing the script without
providing any command-line options. The help page is additionally presented at the
bottom of this README page for reference. Documentation regarding the underlying
*MRtrix3* tools can be found in the official
[*MRtrix3* documentation](http://mrtrix.readthedocs.org). Additional information
may be found in the [online *MRtrix3* community forum](http://community.mrtrix.org).

## Error Reporting

Experiencing problems? You can either post a private message to me on the
[*MRtrix3* community forum](http://community.mrtrix.org/u/rsmith), or you can report it
directly to the [GitHub issues list](https://github.com/BIDS-Apps/MRtrix3_connectome/issues).
In both cases, please include as much information as possible; this may include re-running
the script using the ``--debug`` option, which will provide additional information at the
terminal, and preserve temporary files generated by the script within your target output
directory, which can be forwarded to the developer.

### Synopsis

Generate structural connectomes based on diffusion-weighted and T1-weighted image data using state-of-the-art reconstruction tools, particularly those provided in MRtrix3

### Usage

    mrtrix3_connectome.py bids_dir output_dir analysis_level [ options ]

-  *bids_dir*: The directory with the input dataset formatted according to the BIDS standard.

-  *output_dir*: The directory where the output files should be stored. If you are running group level analysis, this folder should be prepopulated with the results of the participant level analysis.

-  *analysis_level*: Level of the analysis that will be performed. Multiple participant level analyses can be run independently (in parallel) using the same output_dir. Options are: participant, group

### Options

#### Options that are relevant to participant-level analysis

+ **--longitudinal**<br>Indicate that longitudinal data were collected, resulting in second-level session folders

+ **--session_label**<br>Specify the session to be processed. This is a string that must match the ses-xxx folder in a longitudinal dataset. Do not include "ses-"

+ **--fmriprep**<br>Indicate that fMRIPrep preprocessed T1-weighted images are available and should be used for registration. To use this option, include the following volume mount when calling docker (e.g, if fMIRPrep outputs are stored in derivatives/fmriprep-1.4.1/fmriprep): "-v derivatives/fmriprep-1.4.1/fmriprep:/fmriprep"

+ **--output_verbosity**<br>The verbosity of script output (number from 1 to 3); higher values result in more generated data being included in the output directory

+ **--parcellation**<br>The choice of connectome parcellation scheme (compulsory for participant-level analysis). Options are: aal, aal2, craddock200, craddock400, desikan, destrieux, hcpmmp1, none, perry512

+ **--preprocessed**<br>Indicate that the subject DWI data have been preprocessed, and hence initial image processing steps will be skipped

+ **--streamlines**<br>The number of streamlines to generate for each subject

+ **--template_reg software**<br>The choice of registration software for mapping subject to template space. Options are: ants, fsl

#### Options specific to the batch processing of subject data

+ **--participant_label**<br>The label(s) of the participant(s) that should be analyzed. The label(s) correspond(s) to sub-<participant_label> from the BIDS spec (so it does _not_ include "sub-"). If this parameter is not provided, all subjects will be analyzed sequentially. Multiple participants can be specified with a space-separated list.

#### Standard options

+ **-d/--debug**<br>In the event of encountering an issue with the script, re-run with this flag set to provide more useful information to the developer

+ **-h/--help**<br>Display help information for the script

+ **-n/--n_cpus number**<br>Use this number of threads in MRtrix3 multi-threaded applications (0 disables multi-threading)

+ **-s/--skip-bids-validator**<br>Skip BIDS validation

+ **-v/--version**<br>show program's version number and exit
